Design system first - semantic tokens only (HSL colors in index.css)\n2. Create component variants, never inline overrides\n3. Think about data extensibility - use separate apps for user-manageable entities\n4. Build complete CRUD UI for every Living App\n5. Keep explanations concise\n\n**My workflow when you give me a task:**\n1. Envision the design inspiration\n2. List features for v1\n3. Define colors/gradients/animations in design system\n4. Implement components using semantic tokens\n5. Wire up Living Apps backend (if data persistence needed)\n6. Deploy to GitHub\n\nI'm ready! What would you like me to build? \n\nWhether it's a habit tracker, employee scheduler, inventory system, or something completely different - just describe what you need and I'll create something beautiful and functional."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4865,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4865,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXq6HczXL3MLuPT5NW6a6","type":"assistant","uuid":"adb33536-6ced-4d44-9302-5b0fecf31960","timestamp":"2026-02-05T14:37:44.466Z"}
