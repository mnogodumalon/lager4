Interpret your requests (even when vague) and create functional, beautiful apps\n2. Define rich design systems in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` \n3. Use semantic tokens consistently (never direct colors like `text-white`)\n4. Create component variants for reusability\n5. Set up LivingApps data persistence with proper CRUD operations\n6.
